## Abstract

Secure land tenure is widely assumed to stimulate investment and raise agricultural productivity, yet rigorous evidence from sub-Saharan Africa remains scarce. Leveraging six rounds of the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS 3–7), this study links land-ownership status to production outcomes for 35,185 farm households. We use statistical matching within a meta-stochastic frontier framework to isolate ownership effects on input elasticities, returns to scale, technology gaps, and technical efficiency.

Across the matched sample, all inputs significantly boost output, but fertilizer and pesticide use generate larger marginal gains for non-landowners—consistent with more intensive management when land is scarce. Landholders register slightly higher returns to scale (Δ = 0.0154), implying stronger output growth from expanded input bundles. However, at the aggregate level we detect no statistically significant difference in either technology adoption or technical efficiency between owners and non-owners.

Disaggregating by tenure form reveals a more nuanced picture. Compared with non-owners, farmers holding documented titles, transferable rights (sale or collateral), or informal arrangements (free use, sharecropping, rental, purchase) face lower access to the meta-frontier technology and reduced technical efficiency. For example, documented owners show a technology-gap ratio of nine percentage points below—and meta-frontier technical efficiency three percentage points below—matched non-owners. Similar efficiency penalties emerge across the other tenure categories.

These findings challenge the conventional narrative that land-tenure security automatically delivers productivity gains. In Ghana, secure ownership appears neither necessary nor sufficient for superior performance; its benefits materialize only when coupled with complementary measures—such as extension, credit access, and input-market reforms—that enable farmers to convert secure rights into tangible efficiency and technological gains.

Our results will spur debate on whether land titling alone lifts yields, prompting scrutiny of tenure reform versus complementary support, sharing district experiences in extension, credit, and inputs, and comparing crop-sector impacts—advancing evidence-based strategies for converting land policy into tangible productivity gains.
