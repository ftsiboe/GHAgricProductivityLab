### Extended abstract

Around 15% of the world’s population—about one billion people—live with a disability, and most of these individuals reside in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Disabilities can be visible or invisible and include physical, mental, or sensory impairments. These challenges often lead to serious problems like poverty, food insecurity, limited job opportunities, poor housing, and inadequate healthcare. International organizations, such as the United Nations, have stressed the need to create better economic opportunities to help end poverty and hunger for everyone.

In sub-Saharan Africa, where farming is the main source of income and employment, people with disabilities are often left out of agricultural opportunities. This exclusion is especially critical in countries like Ghana. Although Ghana has experienced strong economic growth, between 7% and 10% of its population lives with a disability, many of whom are older, women, or live in rural areas where farming is vital. These individuals face discrimination and other barriers that limit their ability to contribute to agriculture.

This study used data from two large national surveys, which covered nearly 20,000 farmers, to explore how disability affects farming productivity. The research compared disabled and non-disabled farmers by looking at how well they could adopt modern farming technology and use their resources efficiently. The analysis showed that farmers with disabilities had lower access to modern technology—a gap of about 12.8% compared to their non-disabled peers. Additionally, when measuring how much of their potential output the farmers achieved, both groups averaged around 67% of what could be possible. However, when compared to an ideal production benchmark, non-disabled farmers performed at about 63.2% of the benchmark, while disabled farmers reached only about 57.4%, indicating a significant gap in productivity.

The study also discovered that the source of this gap depended on which household member had a disability. For instance, if a farmer’s child or spouse was disabled, the primary issue was a lack of access to modern farming technology. When another household member was disabled, both the access to technology and the overall efficiency in managing the farm contributed to the lower productivity.

Overall, the findings highlight a crucial yet overlooked issue: disability creates significant barriers in agriculture that not only affect the income and livelihood of individuals with disabilities but also hinder the overall growth of the agricultural sector. Improving access to modern farming technology and better farm management practices for disabled farmers could help reduce these gaps, promoting more inclusive economic growth and social equity in Ghana.
