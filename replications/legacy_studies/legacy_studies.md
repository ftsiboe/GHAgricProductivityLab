## \## Outputs

### [Nationally Representative Farm/Household Level Dataset on Crop Production in Ghana from 1987-2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4134518) \| [🗂️⚙️](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/releases/download/legacy_studies/30%20Years%20of%20Crop%20Production%20in%20Ghana.zip)

Reliable and comprehensive national agricultural statistics is crucial
not only for agricultural development but general economic
transformation. While data collected via the Living Standards
Measurement Study (LSMS) provides Ghana with this avenue, the reports
from this data generated by the Ghana Statistical Service neither
consider the trends nor in-depth analysis of agricultural statistics.
This paper sets the premise to fill this knowledge gap by harmonizing
and generating a nationally representative micro level dataset from all
previous LSMSs. The harmonized data has the widest geographic and
seasonal coverage of farmers in Ghana. As such it presents a unique
opportunity to empirically analyze key agricultural phenomena at the
household if not at the farmer level.

### [Technology and managerial performance of farm operators by age in Ghana](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11123-023-00679-y) \| [🗂️⚙️](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/releases/download/legacy_studies/2023%20Technology%20and%20managerial%20performance%20of%20farm%20operators%20by%20age%20in%20Ghana.zip)

Farm-level decision-making by resource-constrained smallholder farmers,
such as investment in improved farm management practices and
technologies may considerably be influenced by the age of farm
operators. However, evidence of the effect of farm operators’ age on
farm efficiency and technological endowment, and consequently on
agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa has been inexact. To
contribute to an improved understanding of the
age-efficiency-productivity nexus, this study investigates the impacts
of farm operators’ age on agricultural productivity by evaluating the
managerial performance and technological endowment of the operators,
disaggregated across three age cohorts, viz. the youth, middle-aged and
the aged. We fit the meta-stochastic frontier statistical framework to a
country-wide sample of 24,596 farm households, spanning three decades of
data collection in Ghana. The results show that relative to the
potentials of each age cohort, more output can be generated using
currently allocated inputs, but under improved farm management
practices. Whereas we did not find evidence for possible age-related
technological differences in agricultural production in Ghana, we did
find strong support for possible age-induced managerial differences in
farm production, with youth operators being more efficient than their
middle-aged and aged peers. Consequently, the age of farm operators
significantly affects agricultural productivity in Ghana through their
efficiency of resource allocation. We find these results relevant for
policy attention, in terms of the targeting of support to farm operators
in the various age cohorts and in the country’s quest to achieve greater
agricultural productivity.

### [Taking Stock of Gender Gaps in Crop Production Technology Adoption and Technical Efficiency in Ghana](https://doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2022.2150664) \| [🗂️⚙️](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/releases/download/legacy_studies/2023%20Taking%20stock%20of%20gender%20gaps%20in%20crop%20production%20in%20Ghana.zip)

This paper examines gender disparities in agricultural production by
applying a stylized translog meta-stochastic frontier model to data
pooled from nine cross-sectional surveys spanning approximately three
decades (1986–2017) and covering 12 crops in Ghana. The study finds that
female farmers have technology gap and technical efficiency scores of
23% and 77%, respectively, compared to 18% and 73% for male farmers.
Although the technical efficiency gap of 4% in favor of male farmers has
remained steady, the technology adoption gap for females has
significantly reduced over time. Overall, female farmers operate at 59%
of the potential available through Ghana’s crop production technology,
compared to 61% for their male counterparts. These findings are critical
for shaping policies to reduce gender disparities in agriculture.

### [Starchy Staples Production Shortfall in Ghana: Influence of Technical Inefficiency Versus Ecological Technology Gaps](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284780) \| [🗂️⚙️](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/releases/download/legacy_studies/2023%20Starchy%20staples%20production%20shortfalls%20in%20Ghana.zip)

Starchy staples are essential for the livelihoods of many in Ghana, yet
their productivity remains low. This study uses a unique dataset and
meta-frontier efficiency analysis to determine whether production
shortfalls in cassava, yam, cocoyam, and plantain are due to technical
inefficiency or technology gaps. Results reveal a production shortfall
of about 50% for these crops, with approximately 45% attributed to
farmer technical inefficiencies and 20% to technology gaps. The findings
suggest that enhancing farmer managerial skills could significantly
improve output in the starchy staples sector.

### [Production Technology, Efficiency, and Productivity of Cereal Farms: Prospects for Enhancing Farm Performance in Ghana](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2022.16) \| [🗂️⚙️](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/releases/download/legacy_studies/2022%20Production%20technology%20efficiency%20and%20productivity%20of%20cereal%20farms%20in%20Ghana.zip)

This paper examines the production technology and performance of Ghana’s
cereal farms using a nationally representative dataset from 26,449 farms
and a meta-stochastic frontier approach. The study finds that key inputs
such as land and seed have the highest impact on cereal output across
various agro-ecological zones. Despite this, significant technical
inefficiencies exist across all zones, indicating room for improvement
in farm management practices. The research highlights variations in
technology adoption and management practices as pivotal for boosting
cereal productivity.

### [Chronic Sources of Low Cocoa Production in Ghana: New Insights from Meta-Analysis of Old Survey Data](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2021.3) \| [🗂️⚙️](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/releases/download/legacy_studies/2021%20Chronic%20Sources%20of%20Low%20Cocoa%20Production%20in%20Ghana.zip)

Analyzing 30 years of production data from a nationally representative
household sample, this study investigates chronic factors behind low
cocoa production in Ghana. The analysis indicates that farmer technical
inefficiency exceeds the regional technology gap by 8 percentage points
and consistently hampers overall performance. The findings imply that
enhancing managerial skills among cocoa farmers could lead to
significant increases in output.

### [Effect of Fertilizer Subsidy on Household Level Cereal Production in Ghana](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2021.e00916) \| [🗂️⚙️](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/releases/download/legacy_studies/2021%20Effect%20of%20fertilizer%20subsidy%20on%20household%20level%20cereal%20production%20in%20Ghana.zip)

This study evaluates Ghana’s nationwide Fertilizer Subsidy Program
(GFSP), launched in 2008, and its impact on cereal yields. Using
matching methods on cross-sectional data from 5,923 cereal-growing
households collected in 2012/13 and 2016/17, the analysis finds that the
program increased cereal yields by 24.5%, with maize farmers showing the
most benefit. The results support the GFSP’s effectiveness in enhancing
agricultural productivity.

### [Spatiotemporal Evaluation of Dry Beans and Groundnut Production Technology and Inefficiency in Ghana](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/310316/?ln=en&v=pdf) \| [🗂️⚙️](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/releases/download/legacy_studies/2021%20Dry%20Beans%20and%20Groundnut%20Production%20Technology%20and%20Inefficiency%20in%20Ghana.zip)

This paper investigates the changes in production efficiency and
technology adoption for dry beans and groundnuts over 15 production
seasons in Ghana. Drawing on a nationally representative dataset of
10,518 farmers, the study uses a meta-stochastic frontier approach to
reveal that while technology gaps have reduced over time, technical
inefficiencies remain a major limiting factor. Key determinants for
these trends include farmer education, mechanization, access to
extension services, and land ownership.

### [Vegetable Production Technical Efficiency and Technology Gaps in Ghana](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/301046/?ln=en&v=pdf) \| [🗂️⚙️](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/releases/download/legacy_studies/2019%20Vegetable%20Production%20Technical%20Efficiency%20and%20Technology%20Gaps%20in%20Ghana.zip)

This study assesses the shortfall in vegetable production in Ghana by
analyzing data from okra, pepper, and tomato farmers using a
meta-stochastic frontier approach. It identifies that the ranking of
production inputs is: land, hired labor, fertilizer, pesticide, and
family labor. The study finds that vegetable production is characterized
by diseconomies of scale, with technical efficiency estimates of 54% for
okra, 74% for pepper, and 58% for tomato. Additionally, technology gaps
vary, being severe for okra, modest for tomato, and nearly non-existent
for pepper, suggesting tailored strategies for each crop.
