## Concept note

This research explores how extracting natural resources—like oil,
minerals, and precious metals—influences agriculture in Ghana. While
natural resources bring significant money to countries, supporting
things like building roads, schools, and hospitals, they can also cause
problems such as environmental damage, soil pollution, and loss of
farmland, negatively impacting agriculture.

Agriculture is crucial for African economies, employing nearly half of
the continent’s workers and significantly contributing to national
income, food security, and rural livelihoods. Improvements in
agriculture also help protect the environment, combat climate change,
and reduce rural poverty.

In Ghana, the discovery of oil and mining activities (especially gold
mining) has boosted economic growth, but it has also posed challenges
for agriculture. This study specifically investigates how being close to
resource extraction sites affects farmers’ productivity and their
farming techniques. It examines these effects over many years and across
various regions and farming communities.

Using advanced statistical methods, the research compares farmers near
resource extraction activities with those further away to measure
differences in farming efficiency and technology use. The study aims to
provide clear evidence on how natural resource extraction impacts
agriculture in Ghana, informing better policies that support sustainable
economic growth without harming agricultural production.
