Agricultural Productivity in Ghana: Replications
================

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

## Overview

For an overview of the broader project context, please refer to the main
[GHAgricProductivityLab
README](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/README.md) in
the repository root.

See the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/LICENSE)
file in the repository root for details.

This directory contains the replication code and related files for the
agricultural productivity project in Ghana. The objective is to provide
a transparent and reproducible analysis framework that validates and
extends the findings presented in published research.

Note that the [legacy
studies](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/tree/master/replications/legacy_studies)
were conducted before the project fully transitioned to GitHub. As such,
their content is not based on the current resources available in this
repository. Nonetheless, legacy files are provided in the individual
study folders to replicate, as closely as possible, the initial studies.

## Structure

Each folder contains scripts, data, and results specific to the study
indicated by its name. The individual studies include:

- **`conflict`**: Examines how conflict and social cohesion affect farm
  production.
- **`disability`**: Investigates the impact of disabilities on farm
  production.
- **`education`**: Analyzes how education influences farm production.
- **`extension`**: Evaluates the effect of extension services on farm
  production.
- **`land_tenure`**: Assesses how land tenure security influences farm
  production.
- **`nonfarm_enterprise`**: Explores how nonfarm enterprise affects farm
  production.
- **`resource_extract`**: Investigates the impact of resource extraction
  activities on farm production.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. For suggestions, improvements, or to report
any issues with the replication code, please open an issue or submit a
pull request. Contributions help improve the reproducibility and
robustness of the research.

Collaborations with enthusiastic and committed graduate students are
welcomed. For more details see the wiki on [Graduate Student Opportunity
to Lead Research on Agricultural Productivity in
Ghana](https://github.com/ftsiboe/GHAgricProductivityLab/wiki/Graduate-Student-Opportunity-to-Lead-Research-on-Agricultural-Productivity-in-Ghana)
