\title{Construct Matching Formulas for Exact and General Matching}
\usage{
write_match_formulas(
  match_variables_exact,
  match_variables_scaler,
  match_variables_factor
)
}
\arguments{
\item{match_variables_exact}{A character vector of variable names to be included
in the exact match component (e.g., \code{"gender"}, \code{"region"}).}

\item{match_variables_scaler}{A character vector of continuous or scalar variable names
to include as covariates in the general match formula (e.g., \code{"age"}, \code{"income"}).}

\item{match_variables_factor}{A character vector of factor variable names
to be included as dummy-coded categorical covariates in the general match formula.}
}
\value{
A named list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{exact_match}}{A string representing the exact match formula (factor variables only).}
\item{\code{general_match}}{A string representing the general match formula, including both
continuous and factor covariates on the right-hand side of \verb{Treat ~}.}
}
}
\description{
Builds two types of matching formulas commonly used in propensity score
or covariate matching workflows:
\itemize{
\item An \strong{exact match} formula specifying categorical variables to match exactly.
\item A \strong{general match} formula specifying numeric and factor covariates for distance-based matching.
}

The function returns both formulas as character strings that can be used
in matching functions such as \code{MatchIt::matchit()} or \code{Matching::Match()}.
