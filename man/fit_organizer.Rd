\usage{
fit_organizer(fit, number_of_inputs, FXN)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{Fitted model object (typically the result of a call to
\code{sfacross()} or a similar frontier regression). The object must
support \code{coef()} and \code{vcov()} methods.}

\item{number_of_inputs}{Integer. Number of input variables in the production function.
This determines how many first-order and second-order terms are expected.}

\item{FXN}{Named object describing the functional form of the production
function. The name (i.e., \code{names(FXN)}) is used to branch between
supported forms:
\itemize{
\item \code{"TL"}: translog.
\item \code{"QD"}: quadratic.
\item \code{"CD"}: Cobb-Douglas.
\item \code{"LN"}: linear.
}
For \code{"TL"} and \code{"CD"}, inputs are expected to enter in logged
form as \code{"lnI1"}, \code{"lnI2"}, \dots; for \code{"QD"} and
\code{"LN"}, in levels as \code{"I1"}, \code{"I2"}, \dots.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{est_coef}: Numeric named vector of organized coefficients.
Names follow the generic parameter labels \code{a_0}, \code{a_1},
\dots, \code{b_i_j}.
\item \code{est_vcov}: Square variance-covariance matrix corresponding to
\code{est_coef}, with row/column names matching the coefficient names.
\item \code{est_list}: Character vector of coefficient names as they were
extracted from \code{fit} (i.e., the original model coefficient labels
used to build \code{est_coef} and \code{est_vcov}).
}
}
\description{
Extracts and structures the coefficients and variance-covariance matrix
from a fitted stochastic frontier (or related) model, mapping them into a
generic parameterization compatible with flexible functional forms such as
Cobb-Douglas, translog, quadratic, and linear frontiers.
}
\details{
For translog and quadratic specifications, the function identifies and
orders both first-order and second-order (interaction) terms. For
Cobb-Douglas and linear forms, it augments the estimated coefficients with
zero-valued second-order terms and builds a conformable variance-covariance
matrix (filled with zeros for the non-estimated interactions), so that
downstream routines can work with a common parameter vector and matrix.

The function constructs three key objects:
\itemize{
\item \strong{est_list}: character vector of coefficient names as they
appear in the fitted model object (e.g., \code{"(Intercept)"},
\code{"lnI1"}, \code{"lnI2"}, interaction terms such as
\code{"I(1/2 * lnI1 * lnI1)"} or \code{"lnI1:lnI2"}, etc.).
\item \strong{est_name}: generic parameter labels corresponding to the
structural coefficients, such as \code{"a_0"}, \code{"a_1"}, \dots for
first-order terms and \code{"b_i_j"} for second-order terms.
\item \strong{est_coef} and \strong{est_vcov}: numeric vector of
coefficients and conformable variance-covariance matrix, reordered and
expanded (for CD/LN) to match the generic parameterization in
\code{est_name}.
}

For Cobb-Douglas and linear specifications (\code{"CD"}, \code{"LN"}), only
first-order terms are typically estimated directly. The function therefore:
\enumerate{
\item Copies the estimated coefficients for first-order terms.
\item Appends zeros for all second-order coefficients so that the length
matches the full parameterization implied by \code{number_of_inputs}.
\item Builds a larger variance-covariance matrix with the original
submatrix in the upper-left corner and zeros elsewhere.
}

This unified representation is useful for elasticities, curvature checks,
and minimum-distance procedures that require a full set of parameters and a
matching variance-covariance matrix regardless of the underlying functional
form.
