\title{Generate Functional and Distribution Forms for MSF Models}
\usage{
sf_functional_forms(number_of_inputs = 5, include_trend = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{number_of_inputs}{Integer. Number of input variables to enumerate
in the functional forms (creates symbols \code{I1..Ik} and \code{lnI1..lnIk}).
Default \code{5}.}

\item{include_trend}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, adjusts the Transcendental
production form (\code{TP}) by dropping the last linear input term.
See \emph{Note} regarding when \code{TP} is present. Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with two components:
\itemize{
\item \code{fxnforms}: named list of character strings for functional forms
(e.g., \code{$CD}, \code{$TL}). Forms that are commented out in the
implementation will not appear.
\item \code{distforms}: named list of distribution specifications; each is
a list with elements \code{[1]} = distribution name and
\code{scaling} = logical.
}
}
\description{
Builds algebraic strings for common production-function specifications and
assembles a catalog of distributional assumptions for one-sided inefficiency
terms used in stochastic frontier / multi-stage frontier (MSF) analysis.
}
\details{
\strong{Functional forms (returned as character strings):}
\itemize{
\item \code{CD}: Cobb-Douglas - sum of logs of inputs, e.g.,
\code{lnI1 + lnI2 + ... + lnIk}.
\item \code{TL}: Translog - \code{CD} plus all second-order log terms
(squares and cross-products), e.g.
\% \item \code{LN}: Linear (commented out in current code).
\% \item \code{QD}: Quadratic (commented out).
\% \item \code{GP}: Generalized (commented out).
\% \item \code{TP}: Transcendental (commented out; see Note).
}

Terms are generated programmatically for \code{k = number_of_inputs}, with:
\code{Ii} denoting input levels and \code{lnIi} their logarithms.

\strong{Distributional forms (list of lists):}
Each entry is named and contains \code{list(name, scaling = <logical>)}.
Included options: \code{hnormal}, \code{tnormal}, \code{exponential},
\code{tslaplace}, \code{genexponential}, \code{tnormal_scaled},
\code{rayleigh}, \code{uniform}, \code{gamma}, \code{lognormal}, \code{weibull}.
The \code{scaling} flag indicates whether the Wang-Schmidt (2002) scaling
property is used in that specification.
}
\note{
The current implementation defines \code{CD} and \code{TL} and removes NULL
entries before returning. Other forms (\code{LN}, \code{QD}, \code{GP}, \code{TP})
are commented out. If you plan to set \code{include_trend = TRUE}, ensure
\code{TP} is actually included in \code{fxnforms}; otherwise, modifying
\code{fxnforms$TP} will not have any effect (and would error if \code{TP}
is not defined).
