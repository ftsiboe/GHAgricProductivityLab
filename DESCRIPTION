Description: Provides tools and datasets for investigating the drivers of agricultural production shortfalls in Ghana. 
 It compiles research studies that examine farmer-specific and institutional factors to assess whether inefficiencies 
 arise from technical inefficiency, technology gaps, or both. The package offers empirical evidence to inform policy 
 discussions and interventions aimed at improving agricultural productivity, 
 particularly in contexts with limited access to modern technologies.
